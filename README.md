##  **Analysis & Methodology**

**Typical data pipeline inside the workbook:**

1. **Import:** Load raw POS CSV/XLSX into the *Raw Data* sheet.
2. **Clean:** Normalize date/time, product names, fix missing categories, and remove duplicates.
3. **Enrich:** Add calculated columns *(Total Sale, AOV, Units per Transaction)*

   *  *Total Sale = Quantity × Unit Price - Discount*
   *  *AOV = Total Sales ÷ Number of Orders*
4. **Aggregate:** Build *PivotTables* for time-series, product/category ranking, and customer segmentation.
5. **Visualize:** Create charts and KPI cards on the *Dashboard* with slicers for interactive exploration.

**Design considerations:**

*  Keep **source data untouched**; perform transformations on separate sheets.
*  Use **structured Tables** to make formulas and pivots resilient to added rows.
*  Use **named ranges** for key metrics to make dashboard formulas clearer.

##  **Key Insights**

Below are the kinds of insights this workbook is designed to surface. *(Replace placeholders with your workbook’s actual values from the pivot outputs.)*

*  **Sales cadence:** Typical peaks during **morning rush (7–10 AM)** and **late afternoon on weekends**.
*  **Monthly trend:** Month-over-month revenue growth/decline *(replace with computed %)*.
*  **Top products:** Top 5 SKUs contributing the majority of revenue.
*  **Category split:** Beverages vs. food — share of revenue and units sold.
*  **Average Order Value (AOV):** Current AOV and suggestions to lift it *(upsell combos, promotions)*.
*  **Customer behaviour:** Repeat vs. new customer ratio and frequency *(if Customer ID is available)*.
*  **Inventory signals:** Slow-moving SKUs *(bottom X%)* that could be promoted or delisted.
